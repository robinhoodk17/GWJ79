Aelia (rodrigues-happy): The reason I was out here was to search for good farmland that is not infected with Black Soil. Old man Abe said he found some normal sized strawberries somewhere around here recently.
Gaiamon (gaiamon-concerned): (?)
Aelia (rodrigues-happy): You know of Black Soil, right? The soil that makes all plants grow super big but also makes them poisonous to humans?
Gaiamon (gaiamon-concerned): (???)
Aelia (rodrigues-happy): Just look for strawberry seeds, grow them on your back and meet me back here. Got that?
Gaiamon (gaiamon-concerned): (...)
Aelia (rodrigues-excited): I'll make you a vegetarian sandwich if you do this little task for me.
Gaiamon (gaiamon-excited): (I will do it! I will do it! I will do it! I will do it! PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASE!!!)
Aelia (rodrigues-happy): Happy to see you look so enthusiastic!! See you soon.
