Galloway (galloway-excited): You did it Gaiamon! Thank you so much!
Gaiamon (gaiamon-happy): (It always feels so weird to be getting praised like this. I just like helping out.)
Galloway (galloway-concerned): I called for my lazy bones assistant Jo to help get the trees off of you, Gaiamon ... but he is a complete no-show. Again.
Galloway (galloway-concerned): If you find that assistant of mine, tell him I have some “choice words” for him.
Gaiamon (gaiamon-happy): (Uh… OKAY!)
Gaiamon (gaiamon-concerned): (Now how am I supposed to do that when I can't speak their language?)
